# Kharkiv.Py #3
**[Kharkiv.Py page on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/groups/kharkivpy/)**

## JavaScript and Python Back-End

Shortlist of implemented functionality:
 - Assets management - JavaScript Templates - Constants within JS files - Browser-specific assets - SCSS/LESS - CDN


**NB:** most of the bundles are not clear and nice. I'll improve each as soon as possible and github it.
